Local incidences will be handled together with the local organisers. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. This code of conduct applies to R-Ladies spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member/guest/participant of/at R-Ladies outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by R-Ladies members, especially the 5 Founding Members, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The Founding Members reserve the right to exclude people from R-Ladies based on their past behavior, including behavior outside R-Ladies spaces and behavior towards people who are not in R-ladies. In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>\n<p><b>Consequences </b></p>\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Founding Members may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all R-Ladies spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other R-Ladies members or the general public. </p>\n<br>\n<p>This policy is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license.</p>\n<br>\n<br>",

Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!&nbsp;</p>\n<p> <br>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Ottawa exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p> <br>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! <br> <br></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.rladies.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rladies.org</a> <br>Twitter: @RLadiesGlobal ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal</a> ) <br>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies</a> <br> <br></p>\n<p><i>PS Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: <br>The leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Ottawa is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. <br> <br></i></p>\n<p><i>Full community guidelines are found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki</a> <br> <br></i></p>\n<p><i>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <br>Photos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

Promoting women's access to STEM careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R Community!

However, the stated priority of this meetup is the development & support of it's female members acting in whichever roles, and we therefore reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures we deem appropriate. All members & event attendees are expected to fully respect each other & the mandate of this Meetup, or face expulsion of any form, whether from events, Meetup membership, or any other Community participation. This Community is a social initiative, hence will never involve charges or fees to participate, unless a member is found to be disrespectful of the goodwill on which the Meetup exists - in this case the Meetup may impose a monetary penalty should the offending member wish to participate in further events (at the discretion of the leadership team).</p>",

We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. <br>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.rladies.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rladies.org</a></p>\n<p>Twitter: @RLadiesGlobal ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal</a> )</p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies</a></p>\n<p>P.S. Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: <br>The leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Nelson is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.</p>\n<p>Full community guidelines are found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki</a></p>\n<p>P.P.S. Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <br>Photos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Nelson event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims. This might include (but is not limited to), the right to use them in their printed and online publicity, social media, press releases and funding applications. If you do not wish to be recorded in these media please inform a community organizer.</p>",
